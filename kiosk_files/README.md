# Kiosk Setup
The instructions here are designd to automate the entire process of turning a raspbery pi into a kiosk.  It will setup files specifically for busstop, but could be used for other applications if you would like to fork it and use it in your own projects.

It will attempt to make backups of any file that is modified, should you want to rever to the original, but please use at your own risk.  Read the script before you run it, espeically as it will run with root privelages.

    ./setup_kiosk.sh
