# Info
busstop :busstop:

Busstop returns current arrival information for busses at the requested stop(s).  It prints the output in a style similar to that of the live bus update signs available at many bus stops throughout London.

Using the TFL API, find the corresponding StopPoint(s) and provide it/them as (an) argument(s) to the script as follows:

`% python busstop.py  490015396S`

## Acknowledgements
Balena.io is a very interesting platform for IoT fleet management.  I saw their blog post about creating a live train time sign under your monitor and was inspired to do something similar for busses. There are a lot of links to other resources from the post and I hope to also do this from a pi zero with a custom case at some point.
